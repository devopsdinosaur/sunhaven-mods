[size=4][b][u]Config Options[/u][/b][/size]

Note that all of the options in this mod default to off (false, zero, blank, etc) to enable the user to have as little of a "cheaty" experience as possible. 

For information on how to modify these options, see the [i]Editing the Config File[/i] section below.

NOTE: If you used the premade BepInEx pack mod or downloaded ConfigurationManager then you can hit F1 to open a dialog to modify options.  Note that some options may not take effect without restarting the game.
To edit the config file outside of the game:
[list=1]
[*]Open notepad or your favorite text editor (Windows Key + R then 'notepad').
[*]File => Open.  Navigate to [i]<[[game]]-home>/BepInEx/config[/i] and open [i][[guid]].cfg[/i].
[*]Each of the options listed above can be modified according to the description.  Lines starting with '#' are just comments.  Lines in [] are section headers.
[*]After making changes, save the file and restart the game to try out the new settings!
